Installation:

No extraction needed since the executable is less than 100 KB.

Download to wherever and run either by the traditional double click method or using the command prompt. Since it is a console application, it should work fine.

Application will automatically close when you win or run out of lives, whoops!

Not the best programmed version of this game but I don't care for bug fixing this particular project since I really only made it to get used to c++ syntax since I am primarily a C# programmer with Unity.
